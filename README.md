## 🚀 Introduction

Bearings are **critical components** in rotating machinery such as **wind turbines, electric motors, and industrial gearboxes**. A bearing failure can lead to **significant downtime, high maintenance costs, and safety risks**.

Traditional condition monitoring techniques rely on **fixed thresholds or Fourier-based spectral analyses**, which may **fail to capture transient or non-stationary faults** effectively.

### Key Features of this Advanced System:

✅ **Morlet Wavelet-based Feature Extraction**: Enhanced handling of non-stationary signals

✅ **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Learns how to weigh different sensors and time steps dynamically

✅ **Residual Gated Convolutions**: Extracts local patterns while controlling feature flow

✅ **Dynamic Thresholding**: Adapts anomaly detection boundaries based on historical data

✅ **Closed-Loop Control**: Outputs **lubrication and pressure** adjustments, with **uncertainty estimates**

The following sections provide an **in-depth exploration** of the **theoretical motivation, detailed system architecture, and potential future research** in industrial predictive maintenance.

## 🎯 Background and Motivation

### **Predictive Maintenance (PdM)**

Predictive maintenance aims to **forecast machinery failures before they occur** by analyzing real-time **sensor data**. Compared to reactive or scheduled maintenance, PdM **minimizes unplanned downtime** and **extends equipment life**.

### **Wavelet Transforms for Rotating Machinery**

Vibration signals often contain **transient components** indicative of early-stage defects (e.g., **spalling in rolling elements**). Wavelet transforms provide a **balance between time and frequency resolution**, surpassing **FFT-based approaches** for transient and non-stationary signal analysis.

### **Multi-Head Attention and Sensor Fusion**

Transformer-based architectures (**Vaswani et al., 2017**) have revolutionized **sequence modeling**. **Multi-head attention** can align and fuse data from various sensors (**temperature, current, load, etc.**) while learning complex **interdependencies and temporal contexts**.

### **Dynamic vs. Static Thresholds**

🚨 **Static thresholds**: Simple but ineffective when operating conditions drift over time.

📈 **Dynamic thresholds**: Learnable mechanisms that adapt based on historical data distributions, reducing **false positives and missed detections**.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The software is built around a **core neural network** `AdvancedBearingControl` and **supplementary modules** for industrial connectivity and data handling.

### **Wavelet-Based Signal Processing**

```python
class WaveletLayer(nn.Module):
    def morlet_wavelet(self, t, freq, scale):
        return torch.exp(1j * freq * t) * torch.exp(-t**2 / (2 * scale**2))
```

✅ **Learnable Frequencies & Scales**: Adjusted via backpropagation for time-frequency decomposition.

✅ **FFT-based Convolution**: Improves computational efficiency.

### **Multi-Head Attention for Sensor Fusion**

```python
class AttentionBlock(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        attn = (q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)) * (1.0 / sqrt(self.head_dim))
```

✅ **Relative Positional Encoding**: Captures periodic signals.

✅ **Multiple Heads**: Each head learns **different dependencies**, enhancing robustness.

### **Residual Gated Convolutional Blocks**

```python
class ResidualGatedBlock(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        gate = self.gate(x)
        return x * gate + residual
```

✅ **Residual Connections**: Helps **gradient flow** and **feature preservation**.

✅ **Gating Mechanism**: Learns which features are **relevant**.

### **Dynamic Thresholding & Anomaly Detection**

```python
threshold = self.threshold_net(stats)  # Scaled sigmoid output
return threshold * 3 * std + mean
```

✅ **Adaptive behavior**: Adjusts based on operating conditions.

✅ **Flexibility**: Can integrate higher-order statistics (e.g., skewness, kurtosis).

### **Control Heads & Uncertainty Estimation**

1. **Pressure Control**: Normalized signal for lubrication pressure.

2. **Lubrication Control**: Controls lubricant flow.

3. **Uncertainty**: Confidence estimates via **Softplus activation**.
